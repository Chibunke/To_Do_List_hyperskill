# To_Do_List_hyperskill
This is my sixth project on hyperskill.
Time is a very important aspect of our life,especailly as a programmer meeting up with an asigned task on time is as important as the tesk given, and the only way tokeep beating time in its own game is by having a shedule. This is nothing more than plaining yourself with the avalible time.always time yourself, creating a list of sub-taskes which make a task and asign time to them. this will increase yor focus and your productivity as well. always having a target is the goal.
